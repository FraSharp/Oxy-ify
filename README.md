# Oxy-ify

Oxy-ify is a fantastic Magisk Module that will turn your Android phone into a OnePlus device by adding:

- the Oxygen OS boot animation;
- the Oxygen OS media sounds;
- the Oxygen OS apps (Camera, Gallery, Sound Recorder, Weather and Widget);
- the OnePlus Widget;
- the OnePlus Slate font.

A Unity installer is included in the module. That means that you can choose to install just what you prefer during the installation process.
