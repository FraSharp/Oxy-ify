# Bug reporting rules

1. Specify device, custom Rom and Android version;
2. Specify the module version (without using the word latest);
3. Attach installation logs, logcat, app crash log (when available);
4. Be detailed (for example _OnePlus Gallery doesn't work_ is not acceptable, say _OnePlus Gallery isn't installed_ or _OnePlus Gallery force closes_ for example);
5. Don't repeat your bug report;
6. Don't tag the admins.

Reporting a bug without these rules will result in a warn or I'll simply ignore it.
